  - Be sure to have React Native [installed](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies), as well as [Android Studio & AVD](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#android-development-environment).

  - Clone the repo., install npm dependenices.

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/kshvmdn/nba-player-tracker.git
    $ cd nba-player-tracker/NBAPlayerTracker
    $ npm install
    ```

### Usage

  - I strongly suggest using this with an actual device if you can, but an emulator should work just as well.

  - With a device connected (or emulator running):

    ```sh
    $ react-native run-android
    ```
